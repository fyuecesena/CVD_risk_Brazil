# WHO_CVD_risk_Brazil
R code to create new variables in a dataset for WHO CVD risk calibrated for Tropical Latin America and the corresponding sex- and age-specific percentile (based on the ELSA-Brasil population).
These new variables are created after setting variables for sex, age, systolic blood pressure, plasma total cholesterol level, presence of diabetes mellitus, and smoking status.
This is a supplemental material for manuscript “Percentiles of predicted 10-year cardiovascular disease risk by sex and age and their association with estimated long-term atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk”.
